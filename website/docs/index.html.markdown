# VMware vRA7 Provider

The VMware vRA7 provider gives Terraform the ability to work with [VMware vRealize
Automation 7][vmware-vra]. This provider can be used to deploy exisiting blueprints
as deployments.

[vmware-vra]: https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-automation.html

Use the navigation on the left to read about the various resources and data
sources supported by the provider.

## Example Usage

The following abridged example demonstrates a current basic usage of the
provider to launch a virtual machine using the [`vra7_deployment`
resource][tf-vra7-deployment]. 

[tf-vra7-deployment]: /docs/providers/vra7/r/deployment.html

```hcl
provider  "vra7" {
    username = "${var.username}"
    password  = "${var.password}"
    tenant = "${var.tenant}"
    host = "${var.host}"
}

resource "vra7_deployment" "machine" {
  count            = 1
  catalog_item_name = "CentOS 7.0 x64"
  resource_configuration = {
    Linux.cpu = "2"
  }
}
```

See the sidebar for usage information on all of the resources, which will have
examples specific to their own use cases.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are used to configure the VMware vRA7 Provider:

* `username` - (Required) This is the username for vRA7 API operations. Can also
  be specified with the `VRA7_USERNAME` environment variable.
* `password` - (Required) This is the password for vRA7 API operations. Can
  also be specified with the `VRA7_PASSWORD` environment variable.
* `tenant` - (Required) This is the vRA tenant ID vRA API
  operations. Can also be specified with the `VRA7_SERVER` environment
  variable.
* `host` - (Required) This is the vRA server name for vRA API
  operations. Can also be specified with the `VRA7_HOST` environment
  variable.
* `insecure` - (Optional) Boolean that can be set to true to
  disable SSL certificate verification. This should be used with care as it
  could allow an attacker to intercept your auth token. If omitted, default
  value is `false`. Can also be specified with the `VRA7_INSECURE`
  environment variable.
